                Mohandas Gandhi was a leader of India’s independence movement. When India was a colony of Great Britain, Gandhi used nonviolent methods to protest against British rule.
                His efforts earned him the title Mahatma. Mahatma means “great soul.”

                Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. In his youth he learned the religions of Hinduism and Jainism.
                Nonviolence is one of Jainism’s main ideas. During his years at school, Gandhi was considered an average student.
                In 1887 he finished his studies at the University of Bombay. He then moved to England to study law. He returned to India in 1891.
                He tried to start a law career, but he was unsuccessful.

                In 1893 Gandhi took a job in a British colony in South Africa. There he saw Europeans mistreating Indian settlers.
                He got into politics to fight for Indian rights. Gandhi first used his method of nonviolent protest in 1906.
                He told Indians that they should not obey British laws that they thought were wrong.
                He also said they should stay peaceful no matter how they were punished for their actions.
                This new method of protest became known as satyagraha, or “devotion to truth.”

                Gandhi returned to India in 1915. Within a few years he became India’s most powerful political leader.
                He led major protests in 1920–22, 1930–34, and 1940–42. Gandhi’s followers stopped using British goods.
                They refused to enter British courts and schools. In 1930 Gandhi led a protest against a British tax on salt.
                He led Indians on a march to the sea to collect their own salt. Gandhi was sometimes jailed for his actions.

                Gandhi was imprisoned for two years during World War II.
                He and other Indian leaders had demanded immediate independence as India’s price for aiding Britain in the war.
                After he was released, Gandhi continued to work for independence.India finally won its independence in 1947.
                It was a great victory for Gandhi. But he was disappointed because India’s land was divided into two new countries: India and Pakistan.
                Before and after India’s division, the country was torn by clashes between Hindus and Muslims.
                Gandhi tried to make peace. On January 30, 1948, in the city of Delhi, he was shot and killed by a Hindu man.
